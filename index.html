      <!-- Paragraph with embedded link -->
      <p>I have been working in the telecommunication industry for over 4 years, working with companies as large as Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile, to much smaller companies such as Tomorrow Telecom. I got my first break working as a wireless associate for a company called MarketSource and my obsession has grew ever since! Although work is great, I do spend the majority of my free time learning to play the piano, or making new projects in photoshop! I started taking the KU coding bootcamp to learn the knowledge I would need in order to become a developer for Verizon. </p>
